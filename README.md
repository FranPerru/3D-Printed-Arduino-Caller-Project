# 3D-Printed-Arduino-Caller-Project
*An Arduino-based caller with 3D printed parts and LED digits.*
This project involves creating a call panel for a system with 10 positions (puestos), each represented by a button. The goal is to display the number of the position on a visual output when its corresponding button is pressed. The project utilizes two Arduino boards to manage the hardware components efficiently. One Arduino handles the button inputs, while the other controls a series of 14 LEDs arranged to display numbers from 00 to 99.
